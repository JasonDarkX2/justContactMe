#Just Contact Me Contact Form
Simply a Wordpress AJAX contact form plugin with more features. Remastering the one I did ages ago while self learning WordPress development, 
It didn't even have a name lol. Since everyone is doing these remastering things with games, music, and movies. 
I thought why not go back and remaster my very first wordpress plugin I made for myself derp :P Which I now commonly use in other Wordpress projects aswell.
For the most part the latest build of this plugin is live and actively running on my site over @[https://www.JasonDarkX2.com/contact](https://www.JasonDarkX2.com/contact)
So feel to hit me up use the contact form :D
